        "text": "I am a forward-thinking, goal-oriented software engineer with DevOps experience, a reputation for writing well-tested, well-documented, reliable, and clean code and infrastructure. I am passionate about and automating things and designing for scalability. I'm fluent in Typescript and Python and experienced with C# and C++, and I pick up new programming languages easily. I am a team player focused on building robust, scalable systems, completing project objectives within their deadlines, and writing detailed documentation for others. I take pride in my work, and believe that the results that I produce should be my strongest advocate."

        "subHeader": "I love to learn",
        "text": "In all of my endeavors, I am constantly searching to expand my knowledge and abilities. At JMU, I found myself interested in everything STEM, so I took on two intense programs to graduate with degrees in Chemistry and Engineering as well as a minor in Mathematics. Outside of my work and formal education, you can find me reading, learning a new language, or crafting a new project. I am an avid reader, especially of history and sci-fi and I have a deep interest in linguistics and language as well. Currently, I'm proficient in Spanish, currently learning German, and I've dabbled in Swedish, Italian, and Norwegian. As for my craftsmanship, I built several of the furniture pieces which currently furnish my apartment. I also enjoy machining, 3D printing, and welding."

        "subHeader": "I have a unique background",
        "text": "Diversity in thought is one of an organization's greatest strengths. The more diverse a group is, the more unique ideas and perspectives are present in the amalgam, resulting in a more thorough, better thought-out, and more robust final product. I bring with me the unique experience of five years of chemistry education as well as four years of education in multidisciplinary engineering. I am well-versed in physics, thermodynamics, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, history, music, and programming, and I love to apply my knowledge to new problems."
      },
      {
        "subHeader": "I am constantly improving",
        "text": "When I look at code I wrote years ago, I will often feel a slight sense of embarrassment: _\"Did I really write that?\"_ But when I look at my old code and I don't think that, I have a worse feeling: _\"Am I not improving?\"_ It is good to be embarrassed by the quality of your old code because that indicates that your standards and ability now are greater than when the code was written. Sometimes I laugh at the quality of my older projects on GitHub, but I leave them as a reminder of how far I've come, and how much further I will go."
      },
      {
        "subHeader": "I don't miss the forest for the trees",
        "text": "In my engineering classes, I learned how to synthesize vague and abstract project ideas into concrete, quantifiable, and specific requirements, wants, nice-to-haves, etc, and then to convert those into action items. This is a key part of being a leader in a software development team, and it is one of my favorite parts of my job. I love taking a project from the concept phase to the production phase. It is crucial to keep track of the larger puzzle that a given project fits into in all parts of the project lifecycle, and this is something that I am very good at."
      },
      {
        "subHeader": "I pay a lot of attention to the trees",
        "text": "I have always been a detail-oriented thinker, and I take great pride in the quality of my work. This is true in all areas; I love to take my time perfecting a piece of furniture, or re-writing a song. I also love the feeling of satisfaction that I get from writing clean code, but I realize that sometimes the qualities that we think of as \"clean code\" can be at odds with performance or cost optimization, and that sometimes, I have to set aside my craftsman-orientation towards coding in favor of a bigger-picture perspective."
