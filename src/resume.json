I am passionate about designing for scalability and automating things. I'm fluent in Typescript and Python and experienced with C# and C++. I am a team player focused on building robust, scalable systems, completing project objectives within their deadlines, and writing detailed documentation for others."

        "text": "In all of my endeavors, I am constantly searching to expand my knowledge and abilities. At JMU, I found myself interested in everything STEM, so I took on two intense programs to graduate with degrees in Chemistry and Engineering as well as a minor in Mathematics. Outside of my work and formal education, you can find me reading, learning a new language, or crafting a new project. I am an avid reader, especially of history and sci-fi and I have a deep interest in linguistics and language as well. Currently, I'm proficient in Spanish, currently learning German and Italian, and I've dabbled in Swedish and Norwegian. As for my craftsmanship, I recently started a small woodworking shop and have a few pieces to show for it. I also enjoy machining, 3D printing, and welding."

        "text": "Diversity in thought is one of an organization's greatest strengths. The more diverse a group is, the more unique ideas and perspectives are present in the amalgam, resulting in a more thorough, better thought-out, and more robust final product. I bring with me the unique experience of five years of chemistry education as well as four years of education in multidisciplinary engineering. I am well-versed in physics, thermodynamics, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, history, and programming, and I love to apply my knowledge to new problems."

        "subHeader": "I am constantly improving",
        "text": "When I look at code I wrote years ago, I will often feel a slight sense of embarrassment: _\"Did I really write that?\"_ But when I look at my old code and I don't think that, I have a worse feeling: _\"Am I not improving?\"_ It is good to be embarrassed by the quality of your old code because that indicates that your standards and ability now are greater than when the code was written. Sometimes I laugh at the quality of my older projects on GitHub, but I leave them as a reminder of how far I've come, and how much further I will go."
